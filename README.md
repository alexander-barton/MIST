# MIST
The Montreal Imaging Stress Task v2 developed circa 2015.

## Background
This is an updated version of the [Montreal Imaging Stress Task](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1197276/), itself an adaptation of the [TSST](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8255414/).  The MIST was designed to investigate social stress in a scanner setting.
The original version was written in HyperCard (now SuperCard); the update to Java was much needed.  This version uses [JideFX](https://github.com/jidesoft/jidefx-oss) for better UI features.

Added features include:
1. Ability to arbitrarily resize the window.
2. Use of the mouse to select inputs.
3. Toggling inter-trial feedback.
4. Toggling test condition visual feedback.
5. Various QoL updates for use.
